# Tic Tac Toe

A simple, responsive Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This Tic Tac Toe game allows a user to play against the computer. The user plays with 'X', and the computer plays with 'O'. The game detects wins and highlights the winning row, column, or diagonal in green. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, and the first player to get three in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Features

- User plays as 'X', and the computer plays as 'O'
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
- Win detection with winning cells highlighted in green
- Simple and intuitive interface

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. Click on an empty cell to make your move as 'X'.
3. The computer will automatically make its move as 'O'.
4. Continue playing until there is a winner or the board is full (a draw).
5. If you want to play again, simply refresh the page.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game board.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the game board and cells.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic, including user moves, computer moves, and win detection.

## Customization

You can customize the game appearance by modifying the `styles.css` file. Change the colors, fonts, or sizes to suit your preferences. You can also modify the game logic in the `script.js` file if you want to implement additional features or change the behavior of the computer player.
